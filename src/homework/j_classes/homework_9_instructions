        >>> INSTRUCTIONS
                Objective:
                    Use Python to create a testable program that uses one class.

                    Problem domain
                        The gaming industry uses a die as the foundation for many of its games. 
                        In this domain, model a die that returns it’s rolled value.

                    Prerequisites
                        Install Python
                        GitHub account and repository
                        Install and configure Visual Studio Code

        >>> Write Code
                In Visual Studio Code, find the /src/homework/j_classes folder.
                    In the class_a.py file, .

                Write a class named die, with no constructor.
                    public functions:
                        roll()—use random to generate a value from 1 to 6, save value to roll_value
                        get_rolled_value()—return the roll_value
                        __str__ --write code to output: “The rolled value is “ whatever roll_value is

                    private data:
                        roll_value

                Write the Tests to make sure that get_rolled_value returns values from 1 to 6, test at least 3 rolls.

                Write Unit Test

                Test that at least 3 rolls always return a value from 1 to 6.
                
                Run the Unit Tests

        >>> In Visual Studio Code, find the /tests/homework/j_classes folder
                From the source code root folder, find the run_tests.py file.
                    Replace: from tests.homework.xxxxxxx import test_xxxxxx
                                with
                            from tests.homework.j_classes import tests_classes

                    Verify that line has the following statement:
                        Replace xxxxxxx with tests_classes
                            suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromModule(tests_classes)
                        
                        Click on the play button to run the test case.
                        
                        Make sure the test results return ok for the test cases (Fix the code if it fails).
 
        >>> Create and Run the Main Program

In Visual Studio Code, find the /src/homework/j_classes folder find the main.py file. write code to create the following menu.

The program runs until the user chooses to exit.

Write a loop to roll the die, after the roll prompt the user if they want to continue.
Display the result of the roll
